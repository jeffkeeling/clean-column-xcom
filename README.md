# Clean Column X.com

Remove the distractions from the X.com/Twitter sidebar.

This extension removes everything in the sidebar except for search. That means Trending and suggested accounts to follow no longer show up.

This also blocks that content on the /explore page which is what a user sees when searching on mobile.
